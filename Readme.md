## Vision

The Skill Verification project aims to create a decentralized platform where users can endorse others for specific skills, creating verifiable and immutable records of endorsements. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform ensures trust and transparency, allowing individuals to build credibility and showcase their skills through reliable peer endorsements.

## Features

- **Endorse Skill**: Users can endorse others for specific skills, providing recognition on the blockchain.
- **Verify Skill Endorsement**: Anyone can verify if a user has been endorsed for a specific skill, ensuring the authenticity of endorsements.
- **Immutable Endorsement Records**: Endorsements are stored immutably on the blockchain, ensuring that they cannot be tampered with.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Mainnet/Testnet
- **Contract Address**: `0x8a504f9f6d1bf417c91725cc3f7d544ef7f6855f7c23a3dc3b1c2a8afda1e429`

## How It Works

1. **Endorse Skill**:

   - Users call the `endorse_skill` function to endorse another user for a specific skill.
   - The function takes the address of the endorsed user and the skill name as parameters and stores this information along with the endorserâ€™s address.

2. **Verify Skill Endorsement**:
   - Anyone can call the `verify_skill` function to verify if a user has been endorsed for a particular skill.
   - The function checks if the endorsement data matches the provided skill and endorsed person, confirming the validity of the endorsement.

## Future Scope

- **Endorsement Counts**: Track the number of endorsements for each skill, allowing individuals to build a skill profile that reflects peer recognition.
- **Skill Badges**: Develop a badge system where users receive badges based on the number of endorsements they receive, helping to visually showcase expertise.
- **Skill Levels**: Introduce skill levels based on the number of endorsements, providing a way for individuals to grow their expertise in a quantifiable manner.
- **Approval Mechanism**: Allow users to approve endorsements before they are added to their profile, giving them control over which skills are publicly endorsed.
- **Integration with Professional Profiles**: Integrate the endorsement system with professional profiles or resumes to make endorsements easily accessible for employers or collaborators.
- **NFT-Based Endorsements**: Create NFT-based skill endorsements that users can collect and showcase as unique recognition for their skills.
